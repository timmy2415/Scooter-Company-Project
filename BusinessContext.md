# Analyzing Scooter Rentals Data Using Python on Google Colab

In this project, I used and analyzed data about scooter rentals over a two-year period. The goal of this project is to understand and predict daily scooter rentals using linear regression.

Business Application (Prompt): "You work for a company that rents electric scooters. Using these systems, a user can rent a scooter from one place and return it to another. Currently, there are hundreds of scooter-sharing programs around the world."

This project shows how to:
1) Import relevant libraries, clean, and preview the dataset
2) Generate descriptive statistics and pivot tables to gain deeper insights into the dataset
3) Build different types of visualizations using seaborn to easily analyze data trends
4) Conduct a model building process using linear regression to predict daily scooter rentals.
